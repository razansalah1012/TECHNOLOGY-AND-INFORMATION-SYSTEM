## Reflection  
The industry lecture provided valuable insights into the role of ICT in addressing complex industrial challenges and it focused on Petronas' Digital Youth Graduate Programme.  

Through industry talk, I have learned that continuous education and the ability to adapt help build a successful career in the field of technology and communications and that technical experience alone is not enough, but also personal skills and teamwork are of great importance. The session sparked my interest and made me realize that technology can be leveraged to address environmental and global challenges, enhance efficiency, and create great, innovative opportunities in the long term.
