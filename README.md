# Design Thinking Project: Library Management System

## Key Phases of Design Thinking
1. **Empathize**:
   - made interviews with students and staff to identify key challenges:
     - Difficulty locating books
     - Long queues for borrowing
     - Limited study spaces during peak hours 

2. **Define**:
   - Problem Statement: The university library faces diffculties in resource discovery, borrowing, and space management, bringing innovative solutions for a more user-friendly environment.

3. **Ideate**:
   - Brainstormed creative solutions:
     - Mobile app for navigation and study space booking.
     - Automated borrowing kiosks.
     - AI-powered personalized book recommendations.

4. **Prototype**:
   - Developed a mobile app prototype using Figma:
     - Features include a search facility, study space reservation, and a borrowing system interface.

5. **Test**:
   - Tested the prototype with 10 students:
     - 90% found navigation intuitive.
     - Suggestions included adding advanced search filters, real-time notifications, and improved login processes.
     
    ## Reflection
- **Goal**: Address real-world problems with technology solutions.
- **Impact**: Learned the importance of user stories in project development and improved team collaboration.
- **Plan**: Enhance UI/UX design skills and communication with users.
